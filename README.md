    Homework Task 3
    Writen by Chris Burley

# Name of Project:

    Homework Task 3
    Part Names: (1) PyBank   (2) PyPoll

# Description:

    In this project I have created two scripts. Each analyses its own dataset and provides a summary in the gitbash terminal and a text file.

    See screen captures 1 - 4 which I have uploaded to this repository.

# Activation of a script:

    To run one of these scripts: 

    (1) Copy the relevant main.py file, the accompanying Resources file and Analysis file to your local device.
    
    (2) Open gitbash in the same location as the main.py code you wish to execute.
    
    (3) In gitbash, type 'python main.py'.
    
    (4) Locate the text document which has been automatically generated by opening the 'analysis' folder.

    As this is a piece of work that is going to be assessed, i think that it would be wise for me to suggest that contributions NOT be made to this module.

    I would also like to acknowledge Brandon (from our class) for clarifying that the text files generated by our codes should be written directly to the Analysis folder and not simply copied there.
